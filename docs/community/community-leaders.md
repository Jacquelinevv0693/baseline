# Community Leaders

Over 500 people and companies signed up to be notified about the opening of the Baseline Protocol Github repository between March 4th and 19th, 2020. Over 300 of them also signed in as group members. The members represent many of the largest companies in the world, spanning several sectors. They also represent startups, students and talented individuals.

## **Leadership** <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

In an openly governed, open source project, leadership is organic. Anyone interested in following the governance and leading efforts across the various teams and focuses, can become a prominent leader in the community.

> The way to lead is to start something, help something, fix something...even spellcheck something! The way to lead is to get others to amplify what you are doing (best done by listening deeply to others first). The way to lead is to serve your own (and your company's) enlightened self interest. You should be able to directly draw a straight line from your time on this work to real impact for the adoption of this standard.

## Project Governance Board <a href="#your-project-governance-board" id="your-project-governance-board"></a>

The PBG serves as a cross-section of the community, organized by OASIS.

Representing nonprofit organizations, multinational companies, leading startups, and the stakeholder community at-large, the PGB is accountable for ensuring the balance and integrity of the Baseline Protocol. The list of PGB members can be[ found here](https://eea-oasis.github.io/managed-open-project/).

### Technical Steering Committee 2021/22 <a href="#your-technical-steering-committee" id="your-technical-steering-committee"></a>

The technical steering committee (TSC) is accountable to the Project Governance Board for managing conflicts on merges and Core Dev self-organization. It also governs the allocation of grant money. And it meets regularly to set technical roadmaps and ensure progress of the community toward the ubiquitous implementation of the baseline protocol in systems of record everywhere.

On October 27, 2021, the following people were voted in as the TSC through October 2022 and the date of the next election's results.

## Standards Team

The standards team worked through most of 2021 to develop a world-class technical specification that implementers and test developers can use to ensure compliance with the baseline protocol specification. The draft will now be shepherded through the OASIS process of review and amendments, culminating in becoming an official OASIS standard. Standards writing is hard, and reviewing the writing is equally hard. This team deserves the highest regard from the community for its hard-toiling service and commitment to excellence.
